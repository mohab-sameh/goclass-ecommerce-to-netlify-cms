Yemi was born and raised in the concrete jungle of New York City. As a young girl, she loved exploring the city and discovering new things. One day, she stumbled upon a website design class being taught in a nearby park. She was intrigued by how the instructor created beautiful websites using simple code. Yemi signed up for the class and fell in love with web design.

She continued to learn more about web design and soon became one of the most talented designers in the city. Her skills caught the attention of several major companies, but Yemi turned them all down to travel the world and teach web design classes. She also enjoys surfing whenever she has time.

Yemi loves spending her time designing beautiful websites and sharing her knowledge with others
